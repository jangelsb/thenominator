Hello muddah,	Hello fadduh--	Here I am at "Wet Hot American Summah." 	Wow I hate it	Something fierce--	Except the astrophysicist David Hyde Pierce.	He lives in a	Cottage nearby	And boy can he make Jeanane Garofolo sigh.	She's the director	Of Camp Firewood,	Which turns before our eyes into Camp Feelgood.	She is funny	As she's hurrying	Through the camper's names, including David Ben Gurion.	She dreams of bunking	David Hyde Pierce,	Who fears a falling Skylab will crush them first.	(Chorus) 	Let me leave,	Oh mudduh faddah--	From this comic romp in Mother Nature...	Don't make me stay,	Oh mudduh faddah--	In this idiotic motion picture.	Every camper	And each counselor	Is horny, especially Michael Showalter.	He lusts after 	Marguerite Moreau's bod,	But she prefers the lifeguard played by Paul Rudd.	The camp cook, 	Chris Meloni,	Goes berserk because he feels attacked by phonies.	He talks to bean cans	And screams and moans	Periodically because of Post-Traumatic Anxiety Syndrome.	(Chorus)	I want to escape,	Oh mudduh faddah--	Life's too short for cinematic torture.	Comedies like this,	Oh mudduh faddah--	Inspire in me the critic as a vulture.	Ben and McKinley	Achieve their fame	As campers whose love dare not speak its name. Ken Marino 	Doesn't go rafting	Prefering Marisa Ryan, who is zaftig.	Watch David Wain's 	Direction falter, 	Despite the help of co-writer Showalter.	They did The State,	On MTV, 	And of the two that is the one you should see.	Thoughts of "Meatballs"	Cruelly hamper	Attempts by us to watch as happy campers.	Allan Sherman 	Sang on the telly.	I stole from him, and he from Ponchielli.
